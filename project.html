                    Sep.2020 - Dec.2020
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>1. Built a Spark-based web page for users to order food and receive delivery service online (React JS/Bootstrap). </p>
                    <p>2. Implemented token-based login/logout flow with React Router v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT.</p>
                    <p>3. Applied Spark MVC (dependency injection, inversion of control, RESET API, etc.) to support HTTP requests and responses (menu updating, item searching, listing, food ordering, checking out, delivery, etc.).</p>
                    <p>4. Enhanced user search with MongoDB databases to store unstructured data, allow users query in different manners.</p>

                <td>
                    <p>1. Implemented Stop-And-Wait, Go-back-N Protocol to perform reliable data transfer with bit errors and packet loss. </p>
                    <p>2. Designed message format and checking criteria of both protocols (sequence number, ack, checksum, timeout, etc.)</p>
                    <p>3. Allowed proper multi-threaded synchronization with Java concurrency APIs (ThreadPool \& Executor Framework).</p>
                    <p>4. Built corresponding network layer with unreliable best effort service and application layer with multiple senders and receivers to evaluate the performance and reliability (100\%) of the designed protocols.</p>
